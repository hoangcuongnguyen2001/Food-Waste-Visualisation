# Food-Waste-Visualisation
This is a visualisation (with cooperation with Lawrence Zhou: https://github.com/illonion, another Data Science student in Swinburne) about the food waste problem (until 2019) in Australia. This project uses D3 library on JavaScript as the main method for visualisation.

Data source:
- Australia Map, Gerardo Furtado: https://gist.github.com/GerardoFurtado/02aa65e5522104cb692e (JSON file for the choropleth)
- Food Waste Index Report 2021, United Nations Environment Programme: https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/35355/FWD.xlsx
- National Waste Report 2020, Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment:https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/waste/national-waste-reports/2020
- National, state and territory population, Australian Bureau of Statistics: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/national-state-and-territory-population/latest-release
 
Note: The process of creating the visualisation is displayed in the file "Data_Visualisation_Process_Book_3.pdf" here. Currently I could not put a public website for that project, because the original website is hosted in Swinburne's server, but I will try as soon as possible to put the link here as a reference.
